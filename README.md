📈 Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions in Bank Marketing
This project focuses on building a classification model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on personal, campaign-related, and economic indicators. The goal is to help banks optimize marketing efforts and improve customer acquisition strategies.

🔍 Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model that predicts client subscription to term deposits (yes/no) using data collected from marketing campaigns by a Portuguese banking institution.
